# Group Contract Template

A group contract is a document to help you formalize the expectations you have for your group members and what they can expect of you. It will help you think about what you need from each other to work effectively as a team! You will create and agree on this contract as a team.

**PS**: This is to be edited and signed by group members
 

At a minimum, your group contract must address these questions:

**GOALS**

- What are our team goals for this project?
    Collaborate to efficiently finish our work
    Explore and discuss statistical concepts that we do not understand
    Check over each others work

- What do we want to accomplish?
     We are striving to achieve an 80% or more on our final project.
     Efficiently work together to finish the project in time

- What skills do we want to develop or refine?
     Learn more about statistical inference data analysis such as hypothesis testing, regression, statistical algorithms, etc.
     Use learning in a practical setting to run a thorough statistical analysis and bring out useful insights from the data.

**EXPECTATIONS**:

- What do we expect of one another regarding attendance at meetings, participation, frequency of communication, quality of work, etc.?
    Reply message in 24 hour.
    Set deadlines for each part of our work
    Aim at least 80%


**POLICIES & PROCEDURES**:

- What rules can we agree on to help us meet our goals and expectations?
    Show up to the group meetings
    Respond to urgent messages within 24 hours.
    We each contribute to the conversation and do our part of the work on time.
    Contribute to the project


**CONSEQUENCES**:

- How will we address non-performance regarding these goals, expectations, policies and procedures?
    We will give each member 3 warnings if they do not complete their assigned task or do not show up for any meeting.
    We would have to contact the professor if a group member is not doing their part or not responding to messages regarding projects.

- Each member should "sign" (you can just type out your name) at the bottom of the submission.
