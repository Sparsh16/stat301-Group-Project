# Introduction

A motorized vehicle emits around 4.7 tons of carbon dioxide annually (US EPA 2016). To cut down on emissions, bike sharing systems, an innovation from traditional bike rentals, started to emerge as a method of eco-friendly transportation. More than 1000 cities worldwide have implemented a bicycle share program (Lin et al. 2018). From a business perspective, what are factors that effect the number of bicycle rentals became a research area of interest.
In this report, we will be working on a dataset named “Nike Sharing Dataset” from the UCI Machine Learning Repository, which includes detailed data about rental bikes in Capital bikeshare system. This dataset contains columns with information of: hourly and daily count of rental bikes, dates, season, weather, etc. In in this report, we will be looking particularly at which columns can serve as input variables for a predictive model for bike rental counts.
Using the programming language R as a tool for our analysis, we will be attempting to answer the research question: 

> How are our predictor variables statistically significant for predicting the response variable?
